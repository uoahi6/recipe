            <br><br>The amount of solar energy that can be used depends largely on geographical location, the season of the year, and the time of day.</h4>

            Hydro energy can also be harnessed using the natural flow of a river, known as run-of-river hydropower. This method uses a narrow channel to funnel the flow toward a water wheel rather than needing to build a dam.
            <br><br>The electricity created can be stored for later use if demand has already been reached and hydro energy is generally more reliable than both solar and wind energy as it can be used 24/7 in any weather condition.</h4>

        <h4>Geothermal energy is <mark>harnessed from heat that has been trapped underneath the Earth’s crust either since its formation or due to radioactive decay</mark>. Some of this heat will escape naturally in large quantities, typically in the form of a volcanic eruption or geyser, but it can also be captured manually to produce geothermal energy.
            The heated water within a geothermal reservoir is pumped up to a geothermal power plant where it turns into steam, which is then used to operate a turbine to power a generator. <br><br>This generator produces electricity for the grid and the steam is cooled back into water and fed back into the geothermal reservoir to be used again and again.</h4>

            To create energy that can be converted into practical power supplies, <mark>the biomass materials are burned.</mark> When heat energy is given off the burning waste it is directed to turbines with pipes.
            These pipes then turn a number of blades, turbines and generators – all of which are made from a series of coils and magnets. <br><br>This then produces and electrical charge when the magnetic fields producing electricity and being stored as power.</h4>
